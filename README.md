## Welcome. My name is Douglas ðŸ‘‹
I graduated in Computer Science and I have experience in programming microcontrollers, back-end development, data science and engineering. I have also worked in junior companies, startups, as a freelancer, consulting and retail and technology companies.

In the academic field, I worked for one year on the modeling of predictive systems and climate classifiers with data from the National Institute of Meteorology, predicting the price of gasoline in the state of AmapÃ¡. And for another year, I was a PIC-PROBIC UNIFAP scientific initiation scholarship holder, where my research is focused on the modeling of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) of Amazonian musical genres classifiers, musical instrument classification and classification.

I can work in junior companies, startups and consulting companies, doing everything from building APIs, RPA, exploratory analysis and modeling of machine learning algorithms, multi-objective mathematical optimization, creating APIs to serve machine learning models. I can also work with data processing on AWS, doing both ingestion and ETL and Athena queries.

All this baggage and added to the daily contact with the team, allowed me to develop communication, a sense of collectivity and imagine how the deliveries can or may not have a positive impact on the business and always envision what can be done to improve a specific solution or solve everyday problems.
